Hi 👋 My name is AL FAHIM
=========================

Full stack NodeJS, .NET developer
---------------------------------

👋 Hi there! I'm a software developer with several years of experience in the field. I started developing back in 2016, working primarily with .NET technologies. Since then, I've transitioned to working with NodeJS and have gained experience in a variety of related technologies, including React Native, React, NextJS, ExpressJS, NestJS, and Electron. 

I'm passionate about staying up-to-date with the latest trends and best practices in software development, and am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow. In my free time, I enjoy contributing to open source projects and collaborating with other developers in the community. 

Thanks for stopping by my profile, and feel free to reach out if you have any questions or just want to chat!
